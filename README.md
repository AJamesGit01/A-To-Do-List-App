# Overview
This is a simple To-Do List web app that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks, delete tasks, and reorder tasks to set priorities.

# Features
Add Task: Users can enter a task and add it to the list by clicking the Add button.

- Delete Task: Each task has a Delete button to remove it from the list.

- Move Up: An Up button lets users move a task higher in the list to increase its priority.

- Move Down: A Down button lets users move a task lower in the list to decrease its priority.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
